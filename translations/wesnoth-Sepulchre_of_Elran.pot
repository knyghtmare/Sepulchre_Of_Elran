msgid "During an ancient era, the elves were once ruled by a warlock named Elran. For an elf, this individual was masterfully skilled in swordplay, magic, politics, and military tactics. King Elran's intelligence and tactical knowledge was one of the key reasons that allowed the first Alliance of Irdya to triumph over the Chaplain of Darkness. After the war had concluded, he was granted absolute sovereignty over the woodland regions of the world. He ruled his people for many centuries until his death and was buried inside a subterranean crypt near the southern border of Lintair Forest."

Thirty-six years after the founding of the Wesnothian Kingdom, the High Elven Council receives a message from one of their southern border outposts about nightmarish creature sightings near the tomb of their once mighty king. Fearful of the desecration of the remains of the elven dead, the council sends Gioviel, an aspiring sorceress, and a detachment of elven soldiers to investigate and purge out the nightmares."
